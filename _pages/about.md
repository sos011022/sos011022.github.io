# 🧍‍♂️ Biography


I am currently a M.S. student with the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/acvlab/">Advanced Computer Vision Laboratory (ACVLAB)</a> at the Institute of Data Science, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan. I am a passionate computer vision and deep learning researcher. I am fortunate to be advised by and work with Prof. <a href="https://cchsu.info/">Chih-Chung Hsu</a> (NCKU).

I received a B.S. degree at the Department of Statistics and Information Science, Fu Jen Catholic University (FJCU), Taiwan, in 2023. I was advised by Prof. Hao-Chiang Shao.

Find my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GoP7QoNSw2HM5uFkLd8ZpwSbn1-eyQfw/view?usp=sharing" target="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GoP7QoNSw2HM5uFkLd8ZpwSbn1-eyQfw/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (last updated April 11, 2024).

My research interests include: 

- **Computer Vision (Mainly focus on Low-level Vision)**
- **Image/Video Processing and Hyperspectral Image**
- **Data-Efficient Learning and Deep/Machine Learning**
  
I am also exploring other computer vision-related fields which are interested to me, such as Multi-Object Tracking, 3D-scene Reconstruction. I am actively seeking a collaboration. 

In addition, I also enjoy fishing🐬, boxing🥊, cooking🍲, baking🍞 and traveling🌐, welcome to talk about that with me if you have the same hobbyXD.
